    <h3>Portfolio Site Hosted on AWS with S3, CloudFront, Route53, and ACM</h3>
    <li>
      Fill PART
    </li>
    <h3>AI Path Finding in Python</h3>
    <li>
      Developed a pathfinding labyrinth application using Pygame, featuring four selectable maze
      configurations. The project was designed to demonstrate the efficiency and speed of the A*
      algorithm in comparison to Dijkstra’s algorithm. Through interactive simulation, the
      effectiveness of each path finding strategy was analyzed, highlighting the superior
      performance of the A * algorithm and complex maze navigation.
    </li>
    <h3>Couch Potato Couriers Sentiment Analysis in R:</h3>
    <li>
      Utilized four distinct lexicons to assess the general sentiment of customer feedback. Employed
      BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a word embedding technique, to
      train and test predictive models on customer data, facilitating the development of targeted
      solutions for ongoing issues.
    </li>
    <h3>Automated Guided Vehicles Analysis:</h3>
    <li>
      In my capstone course, my team and I applied SQL to analyze why Automated Guided Vehicles
      (AGVs) were failing missions at Shaw Industries’ plant. We analyzed each AGV individually and
      other metrics like time stamps, locations where AGVs ceased operations, and other
      environmental variables to identify root causes. The data helped identify and address the
      specific causes of these disruptions, improving AGV efficiency.
    </li>
    <h3>Predicting Survival on the Titanic using Machine Learning in Python:</h3>
    <li>
      Conducted comprehensive analysis using machine learning techniques to predict survival
      outcomes on the Titanic dataset. The project involved data cleaning, exploratory data
      analysis, and implementing predictive models like logistic regression, decision trees, and
      random forest. The model with ”IsChild” predictor achieved the highest accuracy at 83.12%,
      demonstrating effective data analytics.
